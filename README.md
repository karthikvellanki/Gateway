Built using Vue.js and Bulma.
The project can be run directly by opening the index.html. 
 - Add the URL API
 - Choose a HTTP request method
 - Add paremeters for the request
 - Build the component to render the API explorer component
 - Add the appropriate inputs to the parameters and send the request. The API response will be displayed below.
 
The project doesn't contain a database. The inputs are stored dynamically in an array. 
The array is then converted to an object to enable direct referencing by an id. 
The data in the array is cleared out after the request is sent.
